# logwork `alpha 1.0.0`

A minimalistic, plant-based to-do list that tracks your tasks and motivates you to do them.

## raison d'etre
I have the problem of procrastinating and forgetting to do things on time. A simple to-do list
would be fun to create, and would solve 50% of my problem. However, it's still far too easy to
stop working and rot on Instagram, and then when I look back on my day, I find that I only worked
for 30 minutes and wasted 7.5 hours of my time. This isn't exactly ideal, especially since (as of the
time of writing) I have exams coming up soon. I found a decent solution to my niche problem, which
was just writing down what I did in the past 30 minutes to keep myself accountable to working. 
Logwork is designed to be a digital version of this that saves the paper in my binder.

## usage
Basic usage is designed to be as simple as possible. Write down what you want to accomplish today
(or in the future), then check each box off as you go. You can also write down what you did in the
last X minutes and how productive you felt, and at the end of the day (or whenever you finish working)
the app uses GenAI magic to summarize your day for you to give you some hard-earned dopamine.

## forking and contributing
I don't really expect anyone to want to contribute to / fork this project, but if you do, you will 
need to set up your own Supabase database. Also, please keep code readable and not like mine.
